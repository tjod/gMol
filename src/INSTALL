INSTALLATION VIA COMPILATION 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
gMol is developed using linux although it builds neatly using Windows
or OSX.  Qt4 is a requirement, along with it's qmake system.
You will also need to have installed OpenBabel.
This is available at http://www.openbabel.org.
If you use Ubuntu or RedHat/CentOS, you can get it using the package manager.
Building gMol is as simple as type make from the directory where this
INSTALL is located (gmol/src).

OK, it's not really that simple.
You will probably need to edit qt/ChemDB/chemdb.pro and qt/surf/dbsurf.pro
to reflect where you've installed OpenBabel.

Linux, Windows or OSX
The Makefile in this gmol/src directory is set to compile and install

If you want to compile for a Windows system, I recommend using mingw.
You then need to edit gmol/src/Makefile to use the makefile.mingw32

If you want to compile for a OSX system, you need to install gfortran.
You then need to edit gmol/src/Makefile to use the makefile.osx

Parts of gMol (gramps) use the gfortran compiler, which you will probably have to
install.  Mingw includes gfortran (http://www.mingw.org/wiki/MinGW).   
Use your package manager under linux.  
For OSX, start here: (http://www.macresearch.org/xcode_gfortran_plugin_update)

RUNNING gMol
----------------------------------------------------------------------
gMol uses the environment variables gmol_lib and gramps_lib to locate startup files
and various picture and command files.  It should be assigned before
running gMol, e.g.
 export gmol_lib=$PWD/../lib
 export gramps_lib=$gmol_lib/gramps
 cd qt
 ./gmol
On osx, instead of "./gmol" you start gmol using the command
 ./gmol.app/Contents/MaxOS/gmol
Of course, this all depends on where you've installed gmol.  The example
above is relative to the directory where this INSTALL is located.
