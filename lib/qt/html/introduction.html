 gMol is a desktop app to display and animate molecular models.
 Various styles of atom and bond drawing are available, including "cartoon" drawings for proteins.
 It is also possible to display molecular surfaces, electrostatic potential surfaces,
 electron density surfaces.
<P>
 gMol uses the general-purpose graphics display system called Gramps.
 Gramps is used to display, manipulate and animate general 3-D graphical objects.
 The graphical objects may contain points, lines,
 shaded polygons, spheres and cylinders.  Using these graphics primitives
 more elaborate objects may be created.
 If you need to create models other than those provided by gMol, you can create
 graphics objects using your own programs and incorporate those into the gMol/Gramps display.
 GRAMPS is also a command line graphics language.
 The full power of GRAMPS is available through the use of these commands.

 gMol can be run on any recent Windows, Mac or Linux desktop or laptop computer.
