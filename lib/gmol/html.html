gMol can open and display html files, using either the File/Open URL
menu or the File/Open menu and selecting an html file.
These files can contain any html tags, including images in jpeg, gif
and png formats.  The use of java applets is not supported, nor are
any plugins, such as flash.
Html files can, of course, contain links to other html files or documents.
Links are opened and replace the current page, as usual.
Some html pages use the a tag with the target keyword.
gMol does not handle the use of the target keyword in links.
If you use the target keyword, the link with not work.
<p>
On any webpage opened in gMol, right-clicking will bring up a menu.
This allows you to GoBack, Reload, Delete.
When you select Delete, the web page will disappear along with its
corresponding tab.
You can also
select text and Copy that text to the clipboard by using the right-click menu.
<p>
If the
<a href=pdb.html>link is to a sdf, mol or pdb file,</a>
gMol will automatically display the
molecule(s) in that file.
