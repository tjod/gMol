<h2>Welcome to gMol v1.7</h2>
<p>
 gMol is a desktop app to display and animate molecular models.
 To return to this page, select Help/gMol from the menu bar.
 Use the File/Open menu above to select a PDB or SDF file to display.
 Various styles of atom and bond drawing are available, including "cartoon" drawings for proteins.
 It is also possible to display molecular surfaces, electrostatic potential surfaces,
 electron density surfaces.
 gMol uses the mouse to rotate and
 scale the overall scene containing all objects.  Moving the mouse
 with the left button pressed rotates the scene and the mouse wheel scales it.
 <!--
 The mouse and other
 <A HREF=gramps/html/function.html>devices</A>
 can be assigned to control many aspects of every object by using
 various Gramps commands.
 -->
 </p>
<p>
The main window contains a top menu and several panels.
<ul>
<li>The graphics panel on the right where graphics objects are displayed.
<li>A tabbed panel on the left where one of several panels can be selected for display.
<ul>
<li>This Help panel where gMol or Gramps help content appears.
<li>The gMol panel where the tree of displayed molecules appears.
<li>The hidden, experimental gMol.debug panel where gMol and Gramps object and tree information appears.
<li>The hidden Demos panel where several Gramps demonstration scripts can be run.
<!--
<li>The Control panel, where
 <A HREF=gramps/html/function.html>dials and sliders</A>
 can be used to control graphics objects.
-->
<li>The hidden Log panel where Gramps commands issued by gMol are logged.
</ul>
</ul>
The graphics panel is always shown.
The tabs at the bottom of the left panel allow you to select
which of the tabbed panels is shown.
The View menu in the menu bar can be used to select which of the
tabs are hidden or shown.  An additional panel and View menu entry
is added whenever you open an
html file (File/Open) or request a web document (File/Open URL).
SDF, MOL or PDB files can also be opened using a URL,
<a href=gmol/pdb.html>for example</a> by clicking a link on web site.
See <a href="#learn">below</a> for more information on using html files and
javascript in gMol.
</p>
<p>
If a file named gmol.html exists in your home directory,
it will be automatically loaded into a new panel when gmol starts.
The home directory is $HOME (mac and linux) or %HOME% (windows).
The panel's tab
title is taken from the head/title tag in the gmol.html file.
The file may contain any html and javascript, allowing you, for example,
to easily document and access molecule files in your computer
or external web servers.
See <a href="#learn">below</a> for more information on using html files and
javascript in gMol.
</p>
<p>
gMol uses the general-purpose graphics display system called Gramps.
Gramps is an application used to display, manipulate
and animate 3-dimensional graphics objects composed of
points, lines, shaded polygons, sphere and cylinders.
 If you need to create models other than those provided by gMol, you can create
 Gramps objects using your own programs and incorporate those into the gMol/Gramps display.
</p>
<p>
 Gramps is also a command line graphics language.
 The full power of Gramps is available through the use of these commands.
To use Gramps commands, select the Gramps
tab from the View menu.  Learn more about
<A HREF="gramps/html/index.html">gramps commands</A>,
or select Help/Gramps from the
menu bar.
<p>
Select Help/Demos from the menu bar,
to see a demonstration of some of Gramps capabilities.
