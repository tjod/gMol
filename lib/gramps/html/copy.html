 The <SPAN CLASS=command>copy</SPAN> command is used to make independant copies of objects already
 known to the system. The syntax of the <SPAN CLASS=command>copy</SPAN> command is:
<P>
<P CLASS=indent><SPAN CLASS=command>copy</SPAN> <i>name</i> NEWNAME
<BR 3>
<BR 1>
</P CLASS=indent> where <i>name</i> is any name known to the system, and NEWNAME is any name
 not already known to the system.
<P>
 When a picture is copied, all of the transformations in effect, as
 well as the coordinates describing the picture, are copied into the
 new picture. Thus a copy will appear identical to the original until
 either the copy or the original is transformed. Note that not only
 are the transformation matrices copied, but any <A HREF=function.html><i>device</i></A> and <A HREF=function.html><i>function</i></A>
 assignments are also copied.
<P>
<P CLASS=indent>****Frame copy not yet working****
<BR 3>
</P CLASS=indent> When <SPAN CLASS=command>copying</SPAN> a framed picture the coordinate data is not duplicated,
 but rather, a pointer to this data is copied into the new picture.
 So, if space is tight, a copy of a large picture can be made with
 minimal additional space allocation if the original object is a framed
 picture.
<P>
 Copies may be transformed without affecting the original picture. The
 original picture also has no effect on the copy, except for the
 inheritance by the copy of all transformations of the original at the
 time the copy is made. GROUPS may also be copied. See the section on
 <A HREF=group.html><SPAN CLASS=command>group</SPAN></A> OPERATIONS in the GRAMPS document for more details about <SPAN CLASS=command>copying</SPAN>
 <A HREF=group.html><SPAN CLASS=command>groups</SPAN></A>.
<H4>/prefix</H4>
 <SPAN CLASS=switch>/prefix</SPAN>=name - The <SPAN CLASS=command>copy</SPAN> command will accept a <SPAN CLASS=switch>/prefix</SPAN> <i>switch</i> which
 allows the user to define the prefix to be used when
 constructing new names during the <SPAN CLASS=command>copying</SPAN> of a <A HREF=group.html><SPAN CLASS=command>group</SPAN></A>.
 For example, <SPAN CLASS=command>copy/prefix</SPAN>=NEW will create NEWCUBE,
 NEWSPHERE and NEWSQUARE when a <A HREF=group.html><SPAN CLASS=command>group</SPAN></A> containing CUBE,
 SPHERE and SQUARE is <SPAN CLASS=command>copyed</SPAN>.
