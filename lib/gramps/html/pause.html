 The <SPAN CLASS=command>pause</SPAN> command stops automatic continuous transformations from
 occurring until the <A HREF=continue.html><SPAN CLASS=command>continue</SPAN></A> command is entered. <SPAN CLASS=command>pause</SPAN> will also
 stop automatic delayed updates (see <A HREF=function.html><i>function</i></A>) from happening. This is
 useful if two objects need to be synchronized in their continuous
 transformations. The <SPAN CLASS=command>pause</SPAN> command can be issued first, the
 transformations can be set up, and then the <A HREF=continue.html><SPAN CLASS=command>continue</SPAN></A> command is given.
 In the time between the transformation set-ups no changes will occur
 in continuous transformations for any object.
<P>
 Even while <SPAN CLASS=command>pause</SPAN> is in effect, continuous or delayed update functions
 will happen if you use the <A HREF=advance.html><SPAN CLASS=command>advance</SPAN></A> command. Regardless of the state
 of the <SPAN CLASS=command>pause</SPAN> or <A HREF=continue.html><SPAN CLASS=command>continue</SPAN></A> command, non-continuous transformations are
 updated simply by turning the dial associated with the transformation.
 If it is desired to synchronize two non-continuous transformations,
 simply refrain from turning the dial until both transformations are
 set up.
