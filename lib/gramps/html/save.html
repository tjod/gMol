 <SPAN CLASS=command>save</SPAN> is a useful command for saving the <A HREF=function.html><i>values</i></A> that are currently
 applied to an object. The syntax of the command is:
<P>
<P CLASS=indent><SPAN CLASS=command>save</SPAN> <i>name</i>
<BR 3>
<BR 1>
</P CLASS=indent> where <i>name</i> is any known object name. The effect of the command is to
 list the GRAMPS commands necessary to transform <i>name</i> to its present
 state. If a <A HREF=set.html><SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN></A> COLLECT is in effect, the commands are written to the
 file. Thus the state of an object can be saved at any point.
<P>
 There are several SWITCHES that modify the function of <SPAN CLASS=command>save</SPAN>. The <SPAN CLASS=switch>/all</SPAN>
 <i>switch</i> supercedes any of the SWITCHES described below.
<P>
 It is possible to save only certain active transformations by using
 the switches that name the transformation. For example, note that
 <SPAN CLASS=switch>/scale</SPAN> does not specify that all scale values for the object are to be
 saved, but rather that only scale values are to be considered for
 SAVing, dependant on the <SPAN CLASS=switch>/all</SPAN>,<SPAN CLASS=switch>/active</SPAN>, etc. So, if an object had a
 default value for its X scale, that value would not be <SPAN CLASS=command>saved</SPAN> even if
 the <SPAN CLASS=switch>/scale</SPAN> <i>switch</i> was given. It would be saved if the X scale
 transformation was active. Many of the switches have optional values
 (designated by the [] braces.)
<H4>/all</H4>
 <SPAN CLASS=switch>/all</SPAN> - By default, only transformations which have changed from their
 initial values are saved. In addition, transformations which
 are active, i.e., transformations associated with a <A HREF=function.html><i>device</i></A>, are
 also saved. However, the <SPAN CLASS=switch>/all</SPAN> <i>switch</i> indicates that every
 transformation value is to be saved.
<H4>/active</H4>
 <SPAN CLASS=switch>/active</SPAN> - The <SPAN CLASS=switch>/active</SPAN> <i>switch</i> indicates that only active
 transformations currently linked to a <A HREF=function.html><i>device</i></A> are saved.
<H4>/dials</H4>
 <SPAN CLASS=switch>/dials</SPAN> - The <SPAN CLASS=switch>/dials</SPAN> switch indicates that the name of the <A HREF=function.html><i>device</i></A>
 associated with each transformation is to be saved as well as
 the <A HREF=function.html><i>value</i></A> associated with the transformation.
<H4>/group</H4>
 <SPAN CLASS=switch>/group</SPAN> - The <SPAN CLASS=switch>/group</SPAN> <i>switch</i> indicates that every member of the <A HREF=group.html><SPAN CLASS=command>group</SPAN></A>,
 if <i>name</i> is a <A HREF=group.html><SPAN CLASS=command>group</SPAN></A>, is to be <SPAN CLASS=command>saved</SPAN>.
<H4>/color</H4>
 <SPAN CLASS=switch>/color</SPAN>[=HSV] - Fixes the hue, saturation and/or value for the object.
<H4>/intensity</H4>
 <SPAN CLASS=switch>/intensity</SPAN>[=FST] - Fixes the front, size and/or transparent intensity
 of the object.
<H4>/move</H4>
 <SPAN CLASS=switch>/move</SPAN>[=XYZ] - Saves the move transformations affecting the <A HREF=worlds.html><i>Worlds</i></A> for
 the specified axes.
<H4>/perspective</H4>
 <SPAN CLASS=switch>/perspective</SPAN>[=LRBTHYEW] - Saves the perspective windows affecting the
 <A HREF=worlds.html><i>Worlds</i></A>. The optional values are <A HREF=perspective.html><SPAN CLASS=command>perspective</SPAN></A> keywords.
<H4>/rotate</H4>
 <SPAN CLASS=switch>/rotate</SPAN>[=XYZPQR] - Saves the <A HREF=rotate.html><SPAN CLASS=command>rotate</SPAN></A> transformation. The optional
 value resets the rotation for the axis or axes specified.
<H4>/scale</H4>
 <SPAN CLASS=switch>/scale</SPAN>[=XYZWPQRS] - Saves the scale transformation of the specifed axes.
<H4>/translate</H4>
 <SPAN CLASS=switch>/translate</SPAN>[=XYZWPQRS] - Saves the translation transformations of the
 specified axes.
