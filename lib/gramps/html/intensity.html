 The <SPAN CLASS=command>intensity</SPAN> command is used to alter the intensity of objects on
 display. It also affects the transparency of an object. The syntax
 of the command is:
<P>
<P CLASS=indent><SPAN CLASS=command>intensity</SPAN> <i>name</i> <i>keyword</i> <A HREF=function.html><i>function</i></A>
<BR 3>
<BR 1>
</P CLASS=indent> where <i>name</i> is any name known to the system. <i>keyword</i> is one or
 more of T, A, P, D, Y and E.
 See the help listing for <A HREF=function.html><i>function</i></A> to get more details about <A HREF=function.html><i>function</i></A>.
<P>
 The <i>keyword</i> T stands for transparency.  A value of 0 means not at all
 transparent. A value of 1.0 means that the object will be fully
 transparent (invisible!).
<P>
 The <i>keyword</i> A is the ambient intensity.  P is the specular intensity,
 or the intensity of the hightlight spot.  D is the diffuse intensity.
 Taken together these affect to overall intensity of the object.
 Used in different ratios, these values simulate various materials
 that the object may seem to be made of - reflective plastic, metal,
 dull plastic, etc.
 Y affects the spread of the hightlight, or shinyness of the object.
 A high value for Y give a focused highlight and a low
 value gives a more spread-out hightlight.
 The <i>keyword</i> E is the emissive intensity.  This may have little or no
 effect.
<P>
 If <i>name</i> is a <A HREF=group.html><SPAN CLASS=command>group</SPAN></A>, then each member of the <A HREF=group.html><SPAN CLASS=command>group</SPAN></A> is affected as if
 the <SPAN CLASS=command>intensity</SPAN> command had been given for each member of the <A HREF=group.html><SPAN CLASS=command>group</SPAN></A>.
