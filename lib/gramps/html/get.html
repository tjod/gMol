 The <SPAN CLASS=command>get</SPAN> command retrieves a picture from the disk and displays it on
 the screen. At this point the picture becomes "known" to GRAMPS. The
 file extension is assumed to be pix, but this assumption may be
 overridden by explicitly typing in the extension. Currently, the two
 recognized extensions are pix and qix. If any other extension is
 supplied, that extension is used to locate the file on the disk, but
 the format is assumed to be identical to the format of a pix file.
 For information on pix and qix files, see the <A HREF=help.html><SPAN CLASS=command>help</SPAN></A> topic
 Picture Files. If a file is not found in your directory, GRAMPS will
 search the library directory gramps_lib: for the file. $gramps_lib is
 a UNIX environment variable.
<H4>/name</H4>
 <SPAN CLASS=switch>/name</SPAN>=any_name - Used to create a picture with any_name as its name.
 If you don't use <SPAN CLASS=switch>/name</SPAN>, then the name of the picture
 will be the same as the input file name.
