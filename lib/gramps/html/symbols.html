<HEAD><LINK REL=STYLESHEET TYPE="text/css" HREF="styles.css"></HEAD><H2>Symbols</H2>
 There is a set of $<i>symbols</i> available for use in GRAMPS. These are
 variables which store character strings such as names. There are
 currently 10 of them, named $1 to $10. These variables may be used
 anywhere a command argument is required, and the value of the $<i>symbol</i>
 will replace the $<i>symbol</i> in the command line. For example, if the
 $<i>symbol</i> named $3 had a value of SPHERE, then the following command:
<P>
<P CLASS=indent><A HREF=rotate.html><SPAN CLASS=command>rotate</SPAN></A> $3 x 
  d4 <BR 3>
<BR 1>
</P CLASS=indent> would be equivalent to the command:
<P>
<P CLASS=indent><A HREF=rotate.html><SPAN CLASS=command>rotate</SPAN></A> ssphere 
  x d4 <BR 3>
<BR 1>
</P CLASS=indent> The value of a $<i>symbol</i> may be changed by using the <A HREF=pick.html><SPAN CLASS=command>pick/symbol</SPAN></A>
 command. See the help information on <A HREF=pick.html><SPAN CLASS=command>pick/symbol</SPAN></A>.
<H4>Concatenation</H4>
 If you wish to have a $<i>symbol</i> concatenated to the letter A, for
 example, with the resulting string used for the <i>name</i> of the picture,
 then the correct way to specify the sample command line is:
<P>
<P CLASS=indent><A HREF=scale.html><SPAN CLASS=command>scale</SPAN></A> $1$A,x,d3 
  <BR 3>
<BR 1>
</P CLASS=indent> 
where the extra $ after $1 serves to delimit the end of the $<i>symbol</i> name. 
It is not necessary to use this final $ if another <em>delimiter</em> (a comma, 
a blank, or the end of the line) clearly and unambiguously marks the end of the 
$<i>symbol</i> name. 
<P>
 It is also possible to concatenate two $<i>symbols</i> to produce a single
 string upon substitution. For example:
<P>
<P CLASS=indent><A HREF=rotate.html><SPAN CLASS=command>rotate</SPAN></A> $1,$2$$3,d3 
  <BR 3>
<BR 1>
</P CLASS=indent> When $<i>symbol</i> substitution takes place, the axis specification for this
 <A HREF=rotate.html><SPAN CLASS=command>rotate</SPAN></A> command will be the concatenation of $2 and $3. Either $2 or
 $3 may be the null string.
<P> Although two or more $<i>symbols</i> may be concatenated to form one ARGUMENT, 
  it is never true that a $<i>symbol</i> or the concatenation of several $<i>symbols</i> 
  will be interpreted as two command ARGUMENTs. In other words, if a $<i>symbol</i> 
  contains a <em>delimiter</em>, that <em>delimiter</em> will not be interpreted 
  by GRAMPS as a <em>delimiter</em>.
