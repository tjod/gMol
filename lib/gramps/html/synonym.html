<HEAD><LINK REL=STYLESHEET TYPE="text/css" HREF="styles.css"></HEAD><H2>SYNONYM</H2>
 The <SPAN CLASS=command>synonym</SPAN> command is similar to the <A HREF=copy.html><SPAN CLASS=command>copy</SPAN></A> command in that it causes
 another object to be displayed on the screen which uses the same data
 as an object already on display. The syntax of the <SPAN CLASS=command>synonym</SPAN> command
 is:
<P>
<P CLASS=indent><SPAN CLASS=command>synonym</SPAN> <i>name</i> NEWNAME
<BR 3>
<BR 1>
</P CLASS=indent> where <i>name</i> is an object known to the system, and NEWNAME is the name
 of the new object.
<P>
 Whereas the <A HREF=copy.html><SPAN CLASS=command>copy</SPAN></A> command makes a copy of an object which can transform
 independantly of the original, <SPAN CLASS=command>synonym</SPAN> creates an object whose
 transformations are always identical to those of the original object.
 It would appear that the newly created <SPAN CLASS=command>synonym</SPAN> has no purpose other
 than to have an object drawn twice, effectively doubling its
 intensity. Using the <A HREF=group.html><SPAN CLASS=command>group</SPAN></A> command, however, it is possible to have
 an object and its synonym appear differently on the screen. See the
 section on <A HREF=group.html><SPAN CLASS=command>group</SPAN></A> OPERATIONS in the GRAMPS document for more details
 about <SPAN CLASS=command>synonyming</SPAN> <A HREF=group.html><SPAN CLASS=command>groups</SPAN></A>.
<P>
 If a framed picture is <SPAN CLASS=command>synonymed</SPAN>, the resulting object will transform
 like the original. However, since framing is not a transformation,
 the <SPAN CLASS=command>synonym</SPAN> will be able to be <A HREF=frame.html><SPAN CLASS=command>framed</SPAN></A> as if it were an independent
 object.
<H4>/mark</H4>
 <SPAN CLASS=switch>/mark</SPAN> - The <SPAN CLASS=command>synonym/mark</SPAN> command will mark an object as a synonym
 without creating another object. The <SPAN CLASS=command>synonym/mark</SPAN> command
 accepts only one object name as an ARGUMENT. The purpose of
 this command is to cause implicit duplicates of this object
 (created when it is a member of a <A HREF=group.html><SPAN CLASS=command>group</SPAN></A> that is being <A HREF=copy.html><SPAN CLASS=command>copyed</SPAN></A>
 or <SPAN CLASS=command>synonymed</SPAN>) to be <SPAN CLASS=command>synonyms</SPAN> when the duplicates are created.
<H4>/prefix</H4>
 <SPAN CLASS=switch>/prefix</SPAN>=name - The <SPAN CLASS=command>synonym</SPAN> command will accept a <SPAN CLASS=switch>/prefix</SPAN> <i>switch</i> which
 allows the user to define the prefix to be used when
 constructing new names during the <SPAN CLASS=command>synonyming</SPAN> of a
 <A HREF=group.html><SPAN CLASS=command>group</SPAN></A>.
