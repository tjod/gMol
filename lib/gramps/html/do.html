 GRAMPS commands are normally interpreted as they are typed in. I
 is possible, however, to have GRAMPS read commands from a command
 procedure file (a gin file.) This is accomplished by using the <SPAN CLASS=command>do</SPAN>
 command.
<P>
 The <SPAN CLASS=command>do</SPAN> command is useful for executing a list of commands stored in a
 disk file. The syntax of the command is:
<P>
<P CLASS=indent><SPAN CLASS=command>do</SPAN> FILENAME
<BR 3>
<BR 1>
</P CLASS=indent> where FILENAME is the name of a file known to the operating system.
 A default extension of gin is assumed by GRAMPS but may be overridden
 by explicitly typing the extension as part of the FILENAME. If the
 FILENAME is not found in your directory, GRAMPS will search the
 library directory $gramps_lib for the FILENAME.  $gramps_lib must be
 defined as a UNIX enviroment variable.
<P>
 The file specified by FILENAME is read and its contents are
 interpreted as GRAMPS commands. A gin file may contain the <SPAN CLASS=command>do</SPAN> command
 itself, but such nesting may occur only up to 10 levels deep.
<P>
 If the <A HREF=set.html><SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN></A> VERIFY command has been given, then commands from gin files
 which are being <SPAN CLASS=command>done</SPAN> will be echoed to the terminal as they are
 interpreted.
<P>
 If the <A HREF=set.html><SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN></A> WATCH command is given before <SPAN CLASS=command>doing</SPAN> a file, then the effect
 of each command (if there is a visible effect) on the screen will be
 displayed during the interpretation of the gin file.
<H4>Parameters</H4>
 Parameters may also be passed to command procedures. Like $<i>symbols</i>,
 $<i>parameters</i> have names consisting of a $ followed by a number. These
 $<i>parameters</i> are local to the gin file in which they are used and have
 no effect on $<i>symbols</i> available at GRAMPS command level or on
 $<i>parameters</i> named in any other gin file. The current limit for this
 number is 10.
<P>
 $PARAMETERS may be assigned values using the <A HREF=pick.html><SPAN CLASS=command>pick/parameter</SPAN></A> command,
 but again, the $<i>parameter</i> assigned the value will not be the $<i>symbol</i>
 with the same name, but will be the local $<i>parameter</i>. More
 conveniently, however, $<i>parameters</i> may be assigned values at the time
 the gin file is <SPAN CLASS=command>done</SPAN>. So, when writing a gin file which contains
 $PARAMETERS, you are implying a syntax in the order in which the
 $PARAMETERS are specified when <SPAN CLASS=command>doing</SPAN> the file. $1 always refers to
 the first string specified after the file name, $2 to the second, $6
 to the sixth, and so forth. The <A HREF=set.html><SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN></A> VERIFY command will echo each
 command as it is read from the gin file before the $<i>parameter</i>
 replacement has occurred. It is possible to use the <A HREF=show.html><SPAN CLASS=command>show/parameter</SPAN></A>
 command to show the value of any $<i>parameter</i> within the gin file. The
 syntax of the command is:
<P>
<P CLASS=indent><A HREF=show.html><SPAN CLASS=command>show/parameter</SPAN></A> $<i>parameter</i>
<BR 3>
<BR 1>
</P CLASS=indent> where $<i>parameter</i> is the name of any $<i>parameter</i>. If this argument is
 omitted, the value of each $<i>parameter</i> is shown. Since $<i>parameters</i> are
 local to a gin file, using the command <A HREF=show.html><SPAN CLASS=command>show/parameter</SPAN></A> at GRAMPS
 command level will not refer to the $<i>parameters</i> of any gin file. The
 <A HREF=show.html><SPAN CLASS=command>show/symbol</SPAN></A> command may be used at GRAMPS command level. $<i>symbols</i> may
 be thought of as $<i>parameters</i> local to GRAMPS command level. $<i>symbols</i>
 are local to GRAMPS command level, since reference to $1 within a gin
 file will produce the value of the $<i>parameter</i> $1 and not the $<i>symbol</i>
 $1.
<P>
 Parameters may be concatenated with character strings and other
 parameters. See the help topic SYMBOLS CONCATENATION.
<H4>Adding commands</H4>
 GRAMPS syntax allows a command procedures to be used in such a way
 that they appear to be new commands. When a command line is
 interpreted by GRAMPS, a table of GRAMPS commands is searched. If no
 match for the command name is found, GRAMPS will then search the
 current default directory for a gin file with a name identical to the
 command name not in the command table. If such a gin file is found,
 it is <SPAN CLASS=command>done</SPAN> with replacement of $PARAMETERS as usual. For example, you
 might give the following command:
<P>
<P CLASS=indent>SPIN ADNA D3
<BR 3>
<BR 1>
</P CLASS=indent> GRAMPS would find no command named SPIN, but would find a file called
 SPIN.gin created as in the previous examples. The file would be <SPAN CLASS=command>done</SPAN>,
 after replacement of $PARAMETERS with the strings "ADNA" and "D3".
 Thus it appears as if SPIN were a GRAMPS command. Users can define
 any number of gin files in this way. Remember, however, that gin
 files can be nested only to a current maximum of 10 levels.
<P>
 When constructing gin command files for use as GRAMPS commands,
 remember that GRAMPS allows abbreviations for its own command names,
 but not for your gin file command names. Also, remember that GRAMPS
 will interpret any <i>command</i> typed in as a GRAMPS <i>command</i>, if possible,
 before it searches for a gin file.  There are several .gin files in
 the gramps_lib directory, which gramps always searches for gin files
 AFTER it searches your current directory.  See the '<A HREF=help.html><SPAN CLASS=command>help</SPAN></A> macro'
 entry for some info on these useful files.
