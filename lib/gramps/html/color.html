 The <SPAN CLASS=command>color</SPAN> command is used to change the color of an object. The
 syntax of the command is:
<P>
<P CLASS=indent><SPAN CLASS=command>color</SPAN> <i>name</i> <i>keyword</i> <A HREF=function.html><i>function</i></A>
<BR 3>
<BR 1>
</P CLASS=indent> where <i>name</i> is any known object <i>name</i>. <i>keyword</i> is H, S and/or V.
 <A HREF=function.html><i>function</i></A> is a device or value <A HREF=function.html><i>function</i></A> as described in the section
 on FUNCTIONS. The <i>keyword</i> H stands for hue, S stands for saturation
 and V stands for value (brightness or intensity). The overall color
 of the object could also be affected by the <A HREF=intensity.html><SPAN CLASS=command>intensity</SPAN></A> command.
<P>
 The range of numbers is 0 to 360 for hue (the typical color wheel)
 where 0 is green.  Saturation and Value range from 0.0 to 1.0.
<H4>Hints</H4>
 There are several .gin files in gramps_lib which help you with
 colors.  The following names can be used as gramps commands:
<P>
<P CLASS=indent>cyan blue green grey lavender orange pink purple red white yellow
<BR 3>
<BR 1>
</P CLASS=indent> These commands require the name of the object to be colored as the
 first (and only) argument.  As with all gramps macro commands, you
 may not abbreviate these names, since gramps is looking for a file.
<P>
<P CLASS=indent>Examples:
<BR 3>
red sphere
<BR 3>
blue cube
<BR 3>
<BR 1>
<H4>Numbers</H4>
 The following table will help you decide which colors correspond to
 which GRAMPS values. You may, of course, just use a dial to select
 the color you'd like and not worry about the absolute vaule. See
 also the GRAMPS macro-commands, red, green, blue, etc. in color hints.
