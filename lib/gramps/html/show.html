 The <SPAN CLASS=command>show</SPAN> command is used to show the current state of any object of
 the GRAMPS system in general.
<P>
 The <SPAN CLASS=command>show</SPAN> command may be used to show the transformation currently
 being applied to an object. Other information, such as how the object
 is framed, is also shown. The syntax of this command is:
<P>
<P CLASS=indent><SPAN CLASS=command>show</SPAN> <i>name</i>
<BR 3>
<BR 1>
</P CLASS=indent> where <i>name</i> is any name known to the system.
<P>
 This command is also useful for reminding yourself of which keywords
 are valid for a particular command, since the name of each valid
 keyword appears in the list generated by the <SPAN CLASS=command>show</SPAN> command along with
 the value for the transformation specified by the keyword.
<H4>Outputs</H4>
 The first line printed by <SPAN CLASS=command>show</SPAN> contains eight pieces of information,
 some of which are system variables not needed by the user. In order
 of presentation from left to right these are:
<P>
<P CLASS=indent>Object name
<BR 3>
Object type (Ordinary, Frame, Oneframe, Group)
<BR 3>
Object number
<BR 3>
Object ID (object name in E&S UDATA calls)
<BR 3>
Object location
<BR 3>
Object length
<BR 3>
Object maximum number of frames
<BR 3>
Object current frame on display
<BR 3>
<BR 1>
</P CLASS=indent> Next are shown the values of the various transformations used by
 GRAMPS. Since the transformations (rotate, scale, translate, etc.)
 used in GRAMPS are not commutative, the order in which these
 transformations apply to an object is important. The order (top to
 bottom) in which transformations are listed by the <SPAN CLASS=command>show</SPAN> command is the
 reverse of the order in which these transformations are applied to an
 object. From the list generated by <SPAN CLASS=command>show</SPAN>, one can also see that the Z
 rotation is applied before the X rotation, and that the P, Q, and R
 axis (arbitrary axis) rotations are applied before any of the X, Y, or
 Z axis rotations. It is not possible to alter the order in which
 transformation matrices are applied to objects in GRAMPS.
<P>
 There are several SWITCHES for the <SPAN CLASS=command>show</SPAN> command. Many of the switches
 have optional values (designated by the [ ] braces.)
<H4>/buffer</H4>
 <SPAN CLASS=switch>/buffer</SPAN> - The <SPAN CLASS=switch>/buffer</SPAN> switch of the <SPAN CLASS=command>show</SPAN> command may be used to get
 more information about the display list buffers used in
 GRAMPS. These buffers will function well without user
 intervention, but in some cases it might be useful to modify
 the buffering for better system response. Currently, the
 buffering may be altered by turning it completely off (<A HREF=set.html><SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN></A>
 NOBUFFERED) or by changing the SPILL parameter (see <A HREF=set.html><SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN></A>
 SPILL.) The <SPAN CLASS=command>show/buffer</SPAN> command is useful for monitoring
 the effect of changing the SPILL size.
<H4>/dials</H4>
 <SPAN CLASS=switch>/dials</SPAN> - The <SPAN CLASS=switch>/dials</SPAN> <i>switch</i> shows the names of the objects which
 currently have transformations associated with each of the
 <A HREF=function.html><i>devices</i></A>. This is very useful for seeing which <A HREF=function.html><i>devices</i></A> are free.
<H4>/fix</H4>
 <SPAN CLASS=switch>/fix</SPAN>[object] - Shows the values of the 4 X 4 fix matrix for the object
 It is 4 records each of 4 values. See the appendix on
 homogeneous coordinate techniques in Newman & Sproull.
 See also the <A HREF=fix.html><SPAN CLASS=command>fix</SPAN></A> command which modifies the fix matrix.
<H4>/tfm</H4>
 <SPAN CLASS=switch>/tfm</SPAN>[object] - Shows the values of a 4 X 4 matrix for the object which
 is the result (concatenation) of the transformations
 applied to the object. This matrix would be the fix
 matrix if the <A HREF=fix.html><SPAN CLASS=command>fix</SPAN></A> command were to be given. See also
 <SPAN CLASS=command>show/fix</SPAN>.
<H4>/info</H4>
 <SPAN CLASS=switch>/info</SPAN> - Shows only the information line for the object ID, size, etc.,
 of an object.
<H4>/menu</H4>
 <SPAN CLASS=switch>/menu</SPAN> - Shows the items in the menu. See also <A HREF=insert.html><SPAN CLASS=command>insert/menu</SPAN></A> and <A HREF=remove.html><SPAN CLASS=command>remove/menu</SPAN></A>.
<H4>/move</H4>
 <SPAN CLASS=switch>/move</SPAN>[=XYZ] - Shows the move transformations affecting the <A HREF=worlds.html><i>Worlds</i></A> for
 the specified axes.
<H4>/parameter</H4>
 <SPAN CLASS=switch>/parameter</SPAN> - It is possible to use the <SPAN CLASS=command>show/parameter</SPAN> command to show
 the value of any $<i>parameter</i> within the gin file. The
 syntax of the command is:
<P>
<P CLASS=indent><SPAN CLASS=command>show/parameter</SPAN> $<i>parameter</i>
<BR 3>
<BR 1>
</P CLASS=indent> where $<i>parameter</i> is the name of any $<i>parameter</i>. If this
 argument is omitted, the value of each $<i>parameter</i> is
 shown. Since $<i>parameters</i> are local to a gin file, using
 the command <SPAN CLASS=command>show/parameter</SPAN> at GRAMPS command level will
 not refer to the $<i>parameters</i> of any gin file.
<H4>/perspective</H4>
 <SPAN CLASS=switch>/perspective</SPAN>[=LRBTHYEW] - Shows the perspective windows affecting the
 <A HREF=worlds.html><i>Worlds</i></A>. The optional values are <A HREF=perspective.html><SPAN CLASS=command>perspective</SPAN></A> keywords.
<H4>/point</H4>
 <SPAN CLASS=switch>/point</SPAN>[#N] - Shows the value of the point variable #N. If #N is
 omitted, all point values are shown. See also <A HREF=pick.html><SPAN CLASS=command>pick/point</SPAN></A>.
<H4>/rotate</H4>
 <SPAN CLASS=switch>/rotate</SPAN>[=XYZPQR] - Shows the <A HREF=rotate.html><SPAN CLASS=command>rotate</SPAN></A> transformation. The optional
 value resets the rotation for the axis or axes specified.
<H4>/scale</H4>
 <SPAN CLASS=switch>/scale</SPAN>[=XYZWPQRS] - Shows the scale transformation of the specifed axes.
<H4>/symbol</H4>
 <SPAN CLASS=switch>/symbol</SPAN> - The <SPAN CLASS=switch>/symbol</SPAN> switch is used to show the current value of any
<P CLASS=indent>or all of the $<i>symbols</i>. The syntax of the command is:
<BR 3>
<BR 1>
<SPAN CLASS=command>show/symbol</SPAN> $<i>symbol</i>
<BR 3>
<BR 1>
</P CLASS=indent> The value of the named $<i>symbol</i> will be printed. If no
 argument is given, the value of each symbol will be printed.
 The <SPAN CLASS=command>show/symbol</SPAN> command is only valid at GRAMPS command
 level, since $<i>symbols</i> are local to GRAMPS command level.
<H4>/system</H4>
 <SPAN CLASS=switch>/system</SPAN> - The <SPAN CLASS=switch>/system</SPAN> <i>switch</i> will print out some system variables.
 The values of the following variables are typed out.
<P>
<P CLASS=indent>UDFREE = amount of host memory used.
<BR 3>
NOBJ = the number of known objects.
<BR 3>
NIDS = the number of known objects + frames.
<BR 3>
TREEEND = the size of the display tree.
<BR 3>
USSIZE = the total size of the display buffer(s).
<BR 3>
NBUF = the number of display buffers used.
<BR 3>
SPILL = the point at which buffer spillage occurrs.
<BR 3>
<BR 1>
</P CLASS=indent> Also printed is the state of the system with regard to the following:
<P>
<P CLASS=indent>FILMPAUSE                     FRAMECOUNT
<BR 3>
LOWERCASE/NOLOWERCASE         COLLECT/NOCOLLECT
<BR 3>
SENSITIVITY                   TEXTSIZE
<BR 3>
VERIFY/NOVERIFY               WATCH/NOWATCH
<BR 3>
<A HREF=pause.html><SPAN CLASS=command>pause/continue</SPAN></A>
<BR 3>
<BR 1>
</P CLASS=indent> Each of these system parameters may be changed by the user
 by using the <A HREF=set.html><SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN></A> command. For a description of the function
 of these system parameters, see the <A HREF=set.html><SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN></A>, <A HREF=pause.html><SPAN CLASS=command>pause</SPAN></A>, and <A HREF=continue.html><SPAN CLASS=command>continue</SPAN></A>
 commands.
<H4>/table</H4>
 <SPAN CLASS=switch>/table</SPAN> - The <SPAN CLASS=switch>/table</SPAN> switch decodes the table of information about
 objects which is maintained by GRAMPS software. If the
 name of a known object is given as an ARGUMENT to the
 <SPAN CLASS=command>show/table</SPAN> command, the table entries for that object are
 shown. If no ARGUMENT is given, the table entries for all
 known objects plus all known frames are shown. In addition,
 the table entries for the two worlds and for several GRAMPS
 internal objects are shown. This command is expected to be
 of little use to those not interested in modifying GRAMPS
 code.
<H4>/translate</H4>
 <SPAN CLASS=switch>/translate</SPAN>[=XYZWPQRS] - Shows the translation transformations of the
 specified axes.
<H4>/tree</H4>
 <SPAN CLASS=switch>/tree</SPAN> - The <SPAN CLASS=command>show/tree</SPAN> command will list all pictures displayed on the
 screen in the order in which they are displayed. This is
 normally the order in which they were input by the <A HREF=get.html><SPAN CLASS=command>get</SPAN></A> or
 <A HREF=getframe.html><SPAN CLASS=command>getframe</SPAN></A> command (or <A HREF=copy.html><SPAN CLASS=command>copyed</SPAN></A> or <A HREF=synonym.html><SPAN CLASS=command>synonymed</SPAN></A>.) Objects which have
 been <A HREF=blank.html><SPAN CLASS=command>blanked</SPAN></A> are listed in parentehese.
