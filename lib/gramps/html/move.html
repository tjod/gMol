 The <SPAN CLASS=command>move</SPAN> command, like the <A HREF=perspective.html><SPAN CLASS=command>perspective</SPAN></A> command, applies only to LWorld
 or RWorld. The syntax of the command is:
<P>
<P CLASS=indent><SPAN CLASS=command>move</SPAN> <i>name</i> <i>axis</i>,<A HREF=function.html><i>function</i></A>
<BR 3>
<BR 1>
</P CLASS=indent> where <i>name</i> is either LWorld or RWorld, <i>axis</i> is one or more of X, Y,
 and Z, and <A HREF=function.html><i>function</i></A> is described in its own help topic.
<P>
 The effect of the <SPAN CLASS=command>move</SPAN> command is very similar to that of the
 <A HREF=translate.html><SPAN CLASS=command>translate</SPAN></A> command, except that the motion takes place after the
 perspective transformation is applied. So, if the LWorld were
 <A HREF=translate.html><SPAN CLASS=command>translated</SPAN></A>, the perspective view of objects with this world would
 change. However, if the LWorld were <SPAN CLASS=command>moved</SPAN>, the perspective would
 remain the same, but the objects within the LWorld would be shifted on
 the screen. This command is useful for stereo viewing so that the
 LWorld and RWorld can be separated on the screen. The <A HREF=set.html><SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN></A> STEREO
 command sets this <SPAN CLASS=command>move</SPAN> up and the user need not concern himself with
 this.
