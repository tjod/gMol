 The <SPAN CLASS=command>plot</SPAN> command is used to make a hardcopy of what you see on the
 screen. The syntax of the <SPAN CLASS=command>plot</SPAN> command is:
<P>
<P CLASS=indent><SPAN CLASS=command>plot</SPAN> [<SPAN CLASS=switch>/switch</SPAN>] [FILE]
<BR 3>
</P CLASS=indent> where file specifies the Post-script format file which is to be
 written.  If you omit FILE, the output will be written to
 <SPAN CLASS=switch>/usr/tmp/plot</SPAN>.ps. 
<H4>/hold</H4>
 means do not try to automatically print the file.  You
 should use this option until the automatic printing capability
 is extended.
<H4>/noreverse</H4>
 The gramps colors white and black are handled specially.
 Because the background in gramps is (typically) black, but the
 page is white, the <SPAN CLASS=command>plot</SPAN> command makes lines which are drawn white
 in gramps be drawn as black lines.  <SPAN CLASS=switch>/noreversebw</SPAN> causes gramps
 black color to be printed black and white to be printed as white.
<H4>/nocolor</H4>
 produces a file suitable for a black&white postscript device. 
 It causes colors to come out black.  The gramps colors white and
 black are handled specially.  Because the background in gramps is
 (typically) black, but the page is white, the <SPAN CLASS=command>plot</SPAN> command makes
 lines which are drawn white in gramps be drawn as black lines.
 See also the <SPAN CLASS=switch>/noreverse</SPAN> switch.
