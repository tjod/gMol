 The <SPAN CLASS=command>translate</SPAN> command is used to translate objects on the screen. The
 syntax of the command is:
<P>
<P CLASS=indent><SPAN CLASS=command>translate</SPAN> <i>name</i> <i>axis</i>,<A HREF=function.html><i>function</i></A>
<BR 3>
<BR 1>
</P CLASS=indent> where <i>name</i> is the name of a known object. <i>axis</i> is one or more of the
 following letters: X, Y, Z, P, Q, and R. <A HREF=function.html><i>function</i></A> is described in
 its own help topic.
<P>
 The effect of the <SPAN CLASS=command>translate</SPAN> command is to translate the object along
 the specified axis by an amount corresponding to the <A HREF=function.html><i>function</i></A>. X, Y,
 and Z refer to the Cartesian coordinate axes and P, Q, and R refer to
 arbitrary axes. Arbitrary axes can be defined and used by the
 <A HREF=pick.html><SPAN CLASS=command>pick/point</SPAN></A> and <A HREF=use.html><SPAN CLASS=command>use/axis</SPAN></A> commands.
