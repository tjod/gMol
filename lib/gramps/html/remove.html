 Objects can be removed from groups by using the <SPAN CLASS=command>remove</SPAN> command. The
 effect of this command is to remove the object from all grouping and
 place it at the end of the display list. The syntax of the <SPAN CLASS=command>remove</SPAN>
 command is:
<P>
<P CLASS=indent><SPAN CLASS=command>remove</SPAN> ANYNAME
<BR 3>
<BR 1>
</P CLASS=indent> where ANYNAME is any object or group name. Of course, the display on
 the screen reflects the changes made to the tree by the <SPAN CLASS=command>remove</SPAN>
 command.
<H4>/menu</H4>
 <SPAN CLASS=switch>/menu</SPAN> - Causes specified objects to be removed from the menu. The
 syntax of this command is:
<P>
<P CLASS=indent><SPAN CLASS=command>remove/menu</SPAN> <i>name</i> [,<i>name</i>,<i>name</i>...]
<BR 3>
<BR 1>
</P CLASS=indent> where <i>name</i> is any GRAMPS object <i>name</i>. Multiple <i>names</i> may be
 given on one line. The effect of this command is to remove
 the <i>named</i> object from the menu and reinsert it into the <A HREF=worlds.html><i>World</i></A>.
 If the item had been a member of a <A HREF=group.html><SPAN CLASS=command>group</SPAN></A> at the time it had
 been <A HREF=insert.html><SPAN CLASS=command>inserted</SPAN></A> into the MENU, it will not be returned to that
 <A HREF=group.html><SPAN CLASS=command>group</SPAN></A>. It will be put at the end of the TREE.
