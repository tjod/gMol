<HEAD><LINK REL=STYLESHEET TYPE="text/css" HREF="styles.css"></HEAD><H2>INSERT</H2>
 The <SPAN CLASS=command>insert</SPAN> command inserts objects into groups. The syntax of the
 <SPAN CLASS=command>insert</SPAN> command is:
<P>
<P CLASS=indent><SPAN CLASS=command>insert</SPAN> <i>name</i>1 <i>name</i>2
<BR 3>
<BR 1>
</P CLASS=indent> where <i>name</i>1 and <i>name</i>2 are any <i>names</i>. The effect of the <SPAN CLASS=command>insert</SPAN> command
 is to place <i>name</i>1, along with any objects or groups <i>name</i>1 may contain
 (if it is a group itself) into the tree after <i>name</i>2.
<P>
 It is possible to insert groups into groups as well as objects into
 groups. If an object is <SPAN CLASS=command>inserted</SPAN> into itself, no change occurs in the
 tree. If a group is <SPAN CLASS=command>inserted</SPAN> into an object or group which is
 contained by the original group, an error is issued and no change in
 the tree occurs.
<H4>/menu</H4>
 <SPAN CLASS=switch>/menu</SPAN> - All objects in GRAMPS are part of the <A HREF=worlds.html><i>Worlds</i></A>. As such, they
 rotate, scale, etc., within the world. It is possible to
 cause specified objects to be inserted into a menu which is
 not part of the <A HREF=worlds.html><i>Worlds</i></A> and which will remain stationary when
 <A HREF=worlds.html><i>World</i></A> transformations occur. This command has the following
 syntax:
<P>
<P CLASS=indent><SPAN CLASS=command>insert/menu</SPAN> <i>name</i> [,<i>name</i>,<i>name</i>...]
<BR 3>
<BR 1>
</P CLASS=indent> where <i>name</i> is an object name known to GRAMPS. Multiple <i>names</i>
 may be given on one line. The effect of this command is to
 remove the <i>named</i> object from the <A HREF=worlds.html><i>World</i></A> and insert it into the
 MENU. The object will change on the screen, since it is no
 longer undergoing the perspective (and all other)
 tranformations of the <A HREF=worlds.html><i>World</i></A>. The object may still be
 manipulated by GRAMPS transformation and other commands.
 However, items in the menu may not be <A HREF=group.html><SPAN CLASS=command>grouped</SPAN></A>, nor can <A HREF=group.html><SPAN CLASS=command>groups</SPAN></A>
 be inserted into the MENU. <A HREF=frame.html><SPAN CLASS=command>frames</SPAN></A> also may not be inserted
 into the MENU. SYNONYMS and ORDINARY objects may be inserted
 into the MENU.
