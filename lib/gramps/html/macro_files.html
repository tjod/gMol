<HEAD><LINK REL=STYLESHEET TYPE="text/css" HREF="styles.css"></HEAD><H2>Macro files</H2>
 There are some files in gramps_lib which might be useful to you.
 They are .gin files and effectively become new gramps commands.
 See the 'Adding Commands' section for more on this topic.
 You might also take a look at *.gin in gramps_lib and try any of them.
 The sub-topics here are the most generally useful, I think.
<H4>Colors</H4>
 There are several .gin files in gramps_lib which help you with
 colors.  The following names can be used as gramps commands:
<P>
<P CLASS=indent>cyan blue green grey orange pink purple red white yellow
<BR 3>
brown flesh black
<BR 3>
<BR 1>
</P CLASS=indent> These commands require the name of the object to be colored as the
 first (and only) argument.  As with all gramps macro commands, you
 may not abbreviate these names, since gramps is looking for a file.
<P>
 Examples:
<P CLASS=indent>red sphere
<BR 3>
blue cube
<BR 3>
<H4>Nostereo</H4>
 This command returns the system to normal, non-stereo viewing.  Use
 this command after (or between) using the macro gin file commands
 zstereo, fstereo, lstereo or rstereo.
<H4>Stereo</H4>
 This command simply calls the lstereo command.
<H4>Quit</H4>
 This simply executes the gramps <A HREF=exit.html><SPAN CLASS=command>exit</SPAN></A> command.
<H4>3lights</H4>
 The 3Lights command switches on three of the eight Lights and
 sets nice rotation, intensity and color values for them.  It is called
 by the rgb.gin file.
<H4>Right</H4>
 This command produces a perspective view meant for the right eye to
 see in a stereo pair (for making slides or prints).
<H4>Left</H4>
 This command produces a perspective view meant for the left eye to
 see in a stereo pair (for making slides or prints).
<H4>Wiggle</H4>
 This command requires three arguments: the name of the object, the
 device to control its "wiggling" and the initial speed of wiggle.
 Wiggle is simply a <A HREF=frame.html><SPAN CLASS=command>frame</SPAN></A> command and will have no effect on objects
 which were not read using the <A HREF=getframe.html><SPAN CLASS=command>getframe</SPAN></A> command.
 Example:
<P CLASS=indent><A HREF=getframe.html><SPAN CLASS=command>getframe</SPAN></A> fish
<BR 3>
wiggle   fish d8 1000
<BR 3>
<H4>Lstereo</H4>
 This files does a <A HREF=set.html><SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN></A> STEREO and sets the <A HREF=perspective.html><SPAN CLASS=command>perspective</SPAN></A> of LWorld and
 RWorld to effect cross-eyed side by side stereo.  The amount of stereo
 is controlled using the mouse device X1.
<H4>Rstereo</H4>
 This files does a <A HREF=set.html><SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN></A> STEREO and sets the <A HREF=perspective.html><SPAN CLASS=command>perspective</SPAN></A> of LWorld and
 RWorld to effect wall-eyed side by side stereo.  The amount of stereo
 is controlled using the mouse device X1.
<H4>Fstereo</H4>
 This files does a <A HREF=set.html><SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN></A> STEREO and sets the <A HREF=perspective.html><SPAN CLASS=command>perspective</SPAN></A> of LWorld and
 RWorld to effect full screen stereo.  The amount of stereo is controlled
 on the mouse device X1.  Full screen means that the images are not
 separated.  You may use the following commands to separate the images
<P CLASS=indent>PERSP LW p  d8
<BR 3>
PERSP RW p -d8
<BR 3>
<H4>Lwdials</H4>
 This file applies default ROTATION, TRANSLATION and <A HREF=perspective.html><SPAN CLASS=command>perspective</SPAN></A>
 <A HREF=function.html><i>device</i></A> assignments to the LWorld.
<H4>Cd</H4>
 This command requires the name of a directory.  It is analogous to
 the UNIX cd command.  It simply uses the gramps <A HREF=set.html><SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN></A> DEFAULT command.
