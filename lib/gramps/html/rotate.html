 The <SPAN CLASS=command>rotate</SPAN> command is used to rotate an object. The object must have
 been previously read in (via the <A HREF=get.html><SPAN CLASS=command>get</SPAN></A> command). The syntax of a
 <SPAN CLASS=command>rotate</SPAN> command is:
<P>
<P CLASS=indent><SPAN CLASS=command>rotate</SPAN> <i>name</i> <i>keyword</i> <A HREF=function.html><i>function</i></A>
<BR 3>
<BR 1>
</P CLASS=indent> where <i>name</i> is the name of the object, <i>keyword</i> is an axis specified by
 one or more of the characters X, Y, Z, P, Q, and R. <A HREF=function.html><i>function</i></A> may be
 any valid device name (like D3) or a value (like 120) or a more
 complicated <A HREF=function.html><i>function</i></A>. <A HREF=function.html><i>function</i></A> specifications are discussed further
 in the help topic <A HREF=function.html><i>function</i></A>. The <A HREF=function.html><i>value</i></A> specified for a rotation is
 the angle of rotation.
<P>
 The <i>keyword</i> specification indicates the axis about which the object
 should rotate. X, Y, or Z specify the Cartesian coordinate axes. P,
 Q, or R relate to an arbitrary axis system defined by using the
 <A HREF=pick.html><SPAN CLASS=command>pick/point</SPAN></A> and <A HREF=use.html><SPAN CLASS=command>use/axis</SPAN></A> commands. Any combination of these axes is
 allowed.

 Normally, <SPAN CLASS=command>rotate</SPAN> refers its axes to the axes "internal" to the object
 being rotated. This is often what is desired. To see an example of 
 this, <A HREF=get.html><SPAN CLASS=command>get</SPAN></A> AXES and <SPAN CLASS=command>rotate</SPAN> AXES X,D6 Y,D7 Z,D8. On the other hand, it
 can be difficult to orient an object to a desired view using these
 rotation axes. GRAMPS provides a set of "laboratory" axes which are
 parallel to the axes in the room with you (quick - did you just see
 them?). In the default gramps.gin file, the LWorld is using <SPAN CLASS=command>rotate/lab</SPAN>.
 Any other object may also use <SPAN CLASS=command>rotate/lab</SPAN>, but if the LWorld is also
 rotated in any way, the objects LAB axes will be rotated by the LWorld
 rotation. Any other groups that contain an object may also affect its
 rotations, <SPAN CLASS=switch>/lab</SPAN> or otherwise. Since the LWorld can only be affected by
 its own rotations, <SPAN CLASS=command>rotate/lab</SPAN> LWorld always applies to your lab frame of
 reference.
