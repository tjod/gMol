 The <SPAN CLASS=command>restart</SPAN> command will restart the GRAMPS program. This deletes all
 pictures from the screen and reinitializes the graphics system. It is
 possible to modify the restarting procedure of GRAMPS using special
 features of the <SPAN CLASS=command>restart</SPAN> command. When GRAMPS is first initialized,
 or when the <SPAN CLASS=command>restart</SPAN> command is given, various system parameters are
 reSET. This is accomplished by the interpretation of the gramps.gin
 file residing in the gramps_lib: directory. The file contains the
 commands necessary to set up the default rotation and scaling of the
 WORLDS, as well as several <A HREF=set.html><SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN></A> commands. The <SPAN CLASS=command>restart</SPAN> command will
 also cause the interpretation of a file in the current default
 directory with a name of gramps.gin. In this way the user has some
 control over the <SPAN CLASS=command>restart</SPAN> procedure.
<P>
 Note: The output window will not be closed. A set out command used
 after <SPAN CLASS=command>restart</SPAN> will open a new window.
