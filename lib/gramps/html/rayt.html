 This command writes out a file which can be used as input to the
 povray program, rayt program by Tom Palmer, or to rayshade by Craig Kolb.
 You must have installed one of these programs to make much use of the output of this command.
 You can contact Tom P via email as palmer@ncsc.org.  Rayshade is
 available fron princeton.edu via anonymous ftp.
 Any one of these ray-tracers produces high-quality
 renderings of the scene, as you have manipulated it with Gramps.
 Its result should look just like the Gramps output screen at the
 moment you give the <SPAN CLASS=command>rayt</SPAN> command, except for the higher quality
 rendering.  WARNING: it may take a long time to run either of these
 programs, depending on the complexity of the scene.  In my experience,
 RayT is faster, so try it first.
<P>
 The syntax of the command is:
<P>
<P CLASS=indent><SPAN CLASS=command>rayt</SPAN> [filename] [optional args] </P CLASS=indent>
where filename is the name of the output file for the RayT input data. If you 
leave out the file name, Gramps uses <SPAN CLASS=switch>/usr/tmp/plot</SPAN>.ray. 
The optional arguments are passed on to RayT and are not explained here. 
<P> There are several switches for <SPAN CLASS=command>rayt</SPAN>. The <SPAN CLASS=switch>/pov</SPAN> 
  switch causes gramps to output a file in POV format. The <SPAN CLASS=switch>/rayt</SPAN> 
  switch causes gramps to output a file in RayT format. The <SPAN CLASS=switch>/rayshade</SPAN> 
  switch causes gramps to output a file in rayshade format. The <SPAN CLASS=switch>/hold</SPAN> 
  switch causes the output file to be written, but no rendering occurs. If you 
  do not have rayt, rayshade or pov, you should use this switch routinely. If 
  you do have rayt, rayshade or pov, it should be in your path along with the 
  display command. If possible, a rendering will appear in a separate window as 
  soon as rayshade is done, or will appear while rayt is working. If there is 
  no automatic display, You can still create rendered output into a file, but 
  you will have to do it as follows: 
<P>
<P CLASS=indent>RAYTRACE/HOLD filename
<BR 3>
SYSTEM rayt [options] -o filename.rle filename.ray
<BR 3>
or
<BR 3>
RAYTRACE/RAYSHADE/HOLD filename
<BR 3>
SYSTEM rayshade [options] -o filename.rle filename.ray
<BR 3>
or
<BR 3>
RAYTRACE/POV/HOLD filename
<BR 3>
SYSTEM pov [options] -o filename.rle filename.ray
<BR 3>
<BR 1>
</P CLASS=indent> You can then convert the rle files to other types of files using a utility.
<BR 2>
The <SPAN CLASS=switch>/linewidth</SPAN> switch is used to render lines, and possibly 
dots. Rayt and rayshade do not have a line primitive, so Gramps uses cylinders. 
Linewidth is a scale factor for the radius of the cylinder-lines. The default 
linewidth is 1.0, so use a larger or smaller real number as you like. Rayshade 
does not have a dot primitive, so the linewidth factor is used to scale the rayshade 
disc primitive.
