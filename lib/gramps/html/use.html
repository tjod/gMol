 The <SPAN CLASS=command>use</SPAN> command uses two of the previously <A HREF=pick.html><SPAN CLASS=command>picked</SPAN></A> points.
 The syntax of the command is:
<P>
<P CLASS=indent><SPAN CLASS=command>use</SPAN> #N1, #N2 <i>name</i>
<BR 3>
<BR 1>
</P CLASS=indent> where N1, N2 and N3 are point variables (see <A HREF=pick.html><SPAN CLASS=command>pick/point</SPAN></A>)
 The # symbol is a required part
 of the syntax of this command. The effect of the command is to refer
 the arbitrary axis R to the axis specified by the endpoints N1 and N2.
 Using axis R in any <A HREF=rotate.html><SPAN CLASS=command>rotate</SPAN></A> command will cause the picture to rotate
 around the arbitrary axis that the picture is currently USing.
<P>
