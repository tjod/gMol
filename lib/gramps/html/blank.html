 The <SPAN CLASS=command>blank</SPAN> command causes an object to no longer be displayed. The
 syntax of the command is:
<P>
<P CLASS=indent><SPAN CLASS=command>blank</SPAN> <i>name</i>
<BR 3>
<BR 1>
</P CLASS=indent> where <i>name</i> is any name known to the system. All transformations
 applied to the object will still be in effect while the object is
 <SPAN CLASS=command>blanked</SPAN>. In order to have an object reappear, the <A HREF=deblank.html><SPAN CLASS=command>deblank</SPAN></A> command is
 used. The syntax is just like that given above for <SPAN CLASS=command>blank</SPAN>. <SPAN CLASS=command>blanking</SPAN>
 an object does not delete it from the set of known objects; it only
 causes the object to be skipped in the display loop of GRAMPS.
<P>
