 The <SPAN CLASS=command>rename</SPAN> command allows a picture to be renamed. When a picture is
 initially gotten with the <A HREF=get.html><SPAN CLASS=command>get</SPAN></A> or <A HREF=getframe.html><SPAN CLASS=command>getframe</SPAN></A> command, its name is the
 same as its name on the disk. For convenience, a picture may be
 renamed. The syntax of this command is:
<P>
<P CLASS=indent><SPAN CLASS=command>rename</SPAN> OLDNAME NEWNAME
<BR 3>
<BR 1>
</P CLASS=indent> where OLDNAME is a picture name already known to the system and
 NEWNAME is any name not already known to the system. The effect of
 this command is to modify the name by which the picture is known to
 the system. It has no effect on the display.
