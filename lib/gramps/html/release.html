 The <SPAN CLASS=command>release</SPAN> command will unFREEZE an object's transformations. The
 syntax of the command is:
<P>
<P CLASS=indent><SPAN CLASS=command>release</SPAN> <i>name</i>
<BR 3>
<H4>/group</H4>
 <SPAN CLASS=switch>/group</SPAN> - Unlike the <A HREF=intensity.html><SPAN CLASS=command>intensity</SPAN></A>, <A HREF=dash.html><SPAN CLASS=command>dash</SPAN></A>, <A HREF=blink.html><SPAN CLASS=command>blink</SPAN></A>, <A HREF=blank.html><SPAN CLASS=command>blank</SPAN></A>, and <A HREF=frame.html><SPAN CLASS=command>frame</SPAN></A> commands,
 which function on groups by affecting each individual of the
 group, the <A HREF=freeze.html><SPAN CLASS=command>freeze</SPAN></A> and <SPAN CLASS=command>release</SPAN> command may or may not operate
 on each member of the group. If <i>name</i> is a group name and the
 <A HREF=freeze.html><SPAN CLASS=command>freeze</SPAN></A> or <SPAN CLASS=command>release</SPAN> command is given as in the syntax example
 above, then only the group transformations are frozen or
 released. These commands allow the <SPAN CLASS=switch>/group</SPAN> switch, signifying
 that in addition to affecting the group's transformations,
 each member of the group should have its transformations
 affected.
