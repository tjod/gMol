 There is a special object in GRAMPS called LIGHTS.
 There are eight Lights, named Light1 through Light8.
 This provides some
 ability to modify the way lighting is used to render surfaces.  The
 LIGHTS have an ambient component which affects objects evenly accross
 their surface, and a diffuse component which causes surface to be
 lit depending on the angle of the surface and the LIGHTS.  You
 may <A HREF=rotate.html><SPAN CLASS=command>rotate</SPAN></A> the LIGHTS, but <A HREF=translate.html><SPAN CLASS=command>translate</SPAN></A> and <A HREF=scale.html><SPAN CLASS=command>scale</SPAN></A> have no effect.  Try
 <A HREF=rotate.html><SPAN CLASS=command>rotate/lab</SPAN></A> LIGHTS X,D6 Y,D7.
<P>
 You may also use the <A HREF=intensity.html><SPAN CLASS=command>intensity</SPAN></A> command to control the ambient,
 diffuse or other intensity of a LIGHT.
 The ambient intensity of a LIGHT illuminates only the ambient-ness of
 an object set by using the <A HREF=intensity.html><SPAN CLASS=command>intensity</SPAN></A> for that object.  The other
 <A HREF=intensity.html><SPAN CLASS=command>intensity</SPAN></A> features, diffuse, specular also interact only with each other.
 Of course you may use any <A HREF=function.html><i>value</i></A> or <A HREF=function.html><i>function</i></A> in place of dials in
 these examples.
