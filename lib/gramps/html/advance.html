 Delayed updates, as well as continuous updates, are controlled by the
 <SPAN CLASS=command>advance</SPAN> command. The syntax of the <SPAN CLASS=command>advance</SPAN> command is:
<P>
<P CLASS=indent><SPAN CLASS=command>advance</SPAN> <A HREF=function.html><i>value</i></A>
<BR 3>
<BR 1>
</P CLASS=indent> where <A HREF=function.html><i>value</i></A> specifies the number of film frames to advance.
<P>
 The <SPAN CLASS=switch>/noupdate</SPAN> <i>switch</i> causes GRAMPS to advance the given number of
 frames, but without changing the display. This is useful to record a
 number of frames of a still shot. It is especially useful when a
 continuous update is in effect and you want to record still shots.
<P>
 In addition to ADVANCing the specified number of film frames, the
 <SPAN CLASS=command>advance</SPAN> command command will ring the bell on the terminal, but only
 if the <A HREF=set.html><SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN></A> FILMPAUSE command is used.
