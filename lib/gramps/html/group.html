 Groups are names given to groups of objects. A group can be rotated,
 scaled, etc., and each member of the group will reflect that
 transformation. Groups are created with the <SPAN CLASS=command>group</SPAN> command.
<P>
 The <SPAN CLASS=command>group</SPAN> command has the following syntax:
<P>
<P CLASS=indent><SPAN CLASS=command>group</SPAN> <i>name</i>,<i>name</i>,GROUPNAME
<BR 3>
<BR 1>
</P CLASS=indent> where <i>name</i> is any picture or group name, <i>name</i> is any picture or
 group name, and GROUPNAME is any new name not already known to the
 system.
<P>
 The effect of the <SPAN CLASS=command>group</SPAN> command is to group every picture starting
 with <i>name</i> up to and including <i>name</i>, yielding the group named
 GROUPNAME. In order to determine which pictures are between <i>name</i> and
 <i>name</i>, the <A HREF=show.html><SPAN CLASS=command>show/tree</SPAN></A> command is used.
<P>
 Objects can be removed from groups by using the <A HREF=remove.html><SPAN CLASS=command>remove</SPAN></A> command or
 inserted by using the <A HREF=insert.html><SPAN CLASS=command>insert</SPAN></A> command. See the help topics on these
 commands for more information.
