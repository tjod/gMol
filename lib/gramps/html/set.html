<HEAD><LINK REL=STYLESHEET TYPE="text/css" HREF="styles.css"></HEAD><H2>SET</H2>
 The <SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN> command is used to set various system parameters and variables
 which may tailor the GRAMPS environment to your particular needs.
 Many of the parameters which may be set using the <SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN> command are
 shown using the <A HREF=show.html><SPAN CLASS=command>show</SPAN></A> command. The syntax of the command is:
<P>
<P CLASS=indent><SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN> SPECIFIER
<BR 3>
<BR 1>
</P CLASS=indent> where the various SPECIFIERs are described in the subtopics below.
<H4>Alpha</H4>
 When using transparency (See <A HREF=intensity.html><SPAN CLASS=command>intensity</SPAN></A> and the T <i>keyword</i>), the
 <SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN> ALPHA command can control how the transparency is accomplished.
 If your machine has "alpha-planes", gramps can use them to do
 the transparency.  If not, it will use a "screen-door" pattern
 to fill polygons.  The density of the screen determines the amount
 of transparency.  If you do not have alpha planes, then the
 <SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN> ALPHA command has no effect and the screen-door transparency
 is used.  If you do have alpha planes, <SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN> NOALPHA will cause
 the screen-door transparency to be used.  <SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN> ALPHA 4 5 will cause
 the alpha planes transparency to be used.  If you have the
 alpha planes hardware, you may experiment with other <SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN> ALPHA
 numbers, but <SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN> ALPHA 4 5 will always work OK, as will <SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN> NOALPHA.
<H4>Noalpha</H4>
 This turns off transparency using alpha-planes and instead uses a
 "screen-door" patten to simulate transparency.  <SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN> NOALPHA is equivalent to
 <SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN> ALPHA -1, -1.
<H4>Backface and nobackface</H4>
 For polygon and triangle mesh surfaces (including spheres), the backward facing 
polygons can be switched off by giving the <SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN> nobackface 
command. Set backface causes back-facing poygons to be shown. Nobackface means 
they are not shown. Three optional arguments, after the backface keyword, specify 
how bright the backfacing surfaces will be. For example set backface 0.5,1,0 causes 
the back-facing surface to be shown at half ambient intensity, full diffuse intensity 
and zero specular intensity. If the /color switch is used, the backfacing polygons 
are shown in the color specified by three arguments (after the backface keyword). 
These arguments are the hue, saturation and value. For example, set backface 120,0.5,0.5 
shows the backfacing surfaces as a reddish grey. Removing back-facing polygons 
can speed the display of objects. If your surface is totally enclosed, as is a 
sphere, back-facing polygons will always be invisible anyway, so it behooves you 
to use set backface in those cases. 
<P>
<H4>Background</H4>
 The  <SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN> BACKGROUND <A HREF=function.html><i>value</i></A>  command is  used to set the background color on 
 your window.  The <A HREF=function.html><i>value</i></A> ranges from 0 to 255.  0 is black, 255 is white
 and other colors are shades of grey.
<H4>Backhsv</H4>
 The <SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN> BACKHSV command is used to set the background color on your
 workstation. Three numbers should follow the BACKHSV <i>keyword</i>. They
 define the hue, saturation and value of the color to use.
 See the <A HREF=color.html><SPAN CLASS=command>color</SPAN></A> command for more information on how these values
 are interpreted.
<H4>Backrgb</H4>
 The <SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN> BACKRGB command is used to set the background color on your
 workstation. Three numbers should follow the BACKRGB <i>keyword</i>. They
 define the red, green and blue components of the color to use.
 The values are in the range of 0.0 to 1.0.
<H4>Collect </H4>
<P CLASS=indent><SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN> COLLECT
<BR 3>
<SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN> NOCOLLECT
<BR 3>
<BR 1>
</P CLASS=indent> The <SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN> COLLECT command is used to collect commands typed at the
 terminal into a file for later use. The syntax of the command is:
<P>
<P CLASS=indent><SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN> COLLECT FILENAME
<BR 3>
<BR 1>
</P CLASS=indent> If no extension is given for for FILENAME, an extension of gin is
 assumed. If no FILENAME is given, the FILENAME from the previous <SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN>
 COLLECT command is used. If no previous <SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN> COLLECT command had been
 given, then GRAMPS reports an error. Only one <SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN> COLLECT may be in
 effect at any one time.
<P>
 The effect of the <SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN> COLLECT command is to cause each command line to
 be written into the file FILENAME after the line is interpreted by
 GRAMPS. Any command lines which cause an error to be printed are not
 stored in the file. Certain commands, such as <A HREF=show.html><SPAN CLASS=command>show</SPAN></A> and <A HREF=help.html><SPAN CLASS=command>help</SPAN></A> are also
 not collected. If a command line begins with the symbol %, then
 the line is interpreted but not collected. If a command line begins
 with %%, then the line is COLLECTed, but not interpreted. If the
 typed command is a <A HREF=do.html><SPAN CLASS=command>do</SPAN></A> command, that command is stored in the file, but
 the contents of the file that is <A HREF=do.html><SPAN CLASS=command>done</SPAN></A> are not stored in the new file.
 If the <A HREF=do.html><SPAN CLASS=command>doing</SPAN></A> of the file causes an error to be printed, the <A HREF=do.html><SPAN CLASS=command>do</SPAN></A> that
 referred to that file will still appear in FILENAME. The <SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN>
 NOCOLLECT command closes FILENAME and stops the collection of command
 lines until another <SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN> COLLECT command is given. See also the <A HREF=save.html><SPAN CLASS=command>save</SPAN></A>
 command.
<H4>Default</H4>
 The <SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN> DEFAULT command requires another argument: a string
 specifying a default directory for all <A HREF=get.html><SPAN CLASS=command>gets</SPAN></A>, <A HREF=getframe.html><SPAN CLASS=command>getframes</SPAN></A>, <A HREF=do.html><SPAN CLASS=command>dos</SPAN></A>, and <SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN>
 COLLECTs. The saved default directory will be used for commands that
 read or write files.
<P>
 If the directory name
 begins with a dollar sign ($), it is interpreted as an
 environment variable, set by the use before starting GRAMPS.
<H4>Display</H4>
<P CLASS=indent><SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN> DISPLAY
<BR 3>
<SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN> NODISPLAY
<BR 3>
<BR 1>
</P CLASS=indent> It is possible to <SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN> NODISPLAY, which instructs GRAMPS to disallow
 display of all objects until the <SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN> DISPLAY command is given.
<H4>Echo</H4>
<P CLASS=indent><SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN> ECHO
<BR 3>
<SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN> NOECHO
<BR 3>
<BR 1>
</P CLASS=indent> The <SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN> ECHO command causes GRAMPS to echo each command line received
 by GRAMPS. Normally, the line need not be echoed since it will have
 been typed in at the terminal. It is possible for a user-written 
 program to communicate with GRAMPS. For example, a program could
 construct GRAMPS command lines and send them to GRAMPS via the 
 interprocess communcation through which GRAMPS accepts commands. In
 that case, it may be useful to have the command lines echoed. The
 <SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN> NOECHO command causes command to no longer be echoed.
<P>
 If the <SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN> VERIFY command is in effect while <SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN> ECHO is also in
 effect, then command lines retrieved from a file will also be printed.
<P>
 An asterisk (*) as the first character of a GRAMPS line will cause the
 line not to be echoed, regardless of the state of the ECHO flags.
 This is useful when reading a GRAMPS response through interprocess
 communication, without having to worry whether the command line will
 be echoed before the response.
<H4>Filmpause</H4>
<P CLASS=indent><SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN> FILMPAUSE number
<BR 3>
<BR 1>
</P CLASS=indent> The <SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN> FILMPAUSE command requires an additional number argument.
 This number is interpreted as a number of seconds (the number need not
 be an integer) to pause between <A HREF=advance.html><SPAN CLASS=command>advances</SPAN></A>. If <SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN> FILMPAUSE 0 is
 given, then no pause will be made.
<H4>Framecount</H4>
 When filming, the <A HREF=advance.html><SPAN CLASS=command>advance</SPAN></A> command is used to advance the display one
 cycle and to ring the bell on the terminal (to trigger a camera.)
 GRAMPS keeps a count of the number of <A HREF=advance.html><SPAN CLASS=command>advances</SPAN></A> that have occurred.
 This count is shown with the <A HREF=show.html><SPAN CLASS=command>show/system</SPAN></A> command. It is possible to
 set this counter to any number using the <SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN> FRAMECOUNT command. The
 syntax of the command is:
<P>
<P CLASS=indent><SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN> FRAMECOUNT NUMBER
<BR 3>
<BR 1>
</P CLASS=indent> When GRAMPS is
 initialized, the frame counter is 0. <A HREF=restart.html><SPAN CLASS=command>restart</SPAN></A> also resets the frame
 counter to 0.
<H4>Fullerror</H4>
<P CLASS=indent><SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN> FULLERROR
<BR 3>
<SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN> NOFULLERROR
<BR 3>
<BR 1>
</P CLASS=indent> Normally, GRAMPS prints out errors messages when it encounters
 something in a command line that it cannot deal with. In general,
 when <SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN> FULLERROR is in effect, any FORTRAN run time errors that
 accompany normal GRAMPS errors will be reported. <SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN> NOFULLERROR
 turns off this mode of error reporting.
<H4>Hidesurf and nohidesurf</H4>
 Objects composed of polygons, triangle meshes and/or spheres can
 hide each other when one passes in front of the other.  This effect
 can be switched on with HIDESURF and off with NOHIDESURF.
 This essentially corrsponds to using z-buffering (or not).
<H4>Gouraud and flat</H4>
 Polygons are shaded based on the angle between the Light source(s)
 and the normal vector perpendicular to the polygon.  When the
 polygon is shaded all the same color, it appears flat.  If the
 shading is varied, depending on the normals of the neighboring
 polygons and well as the normal of the the polygon being shaded,
 a smoother shading effect results.  Use <SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN> GOURAUD to get this
 smoother shading; use <SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN> FLAT for flat shading.
<H4>Library</H4>
 The <SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN> LIBRARY command requires another argument: a string
 specifying a possible directory for any <A HREF=get.html><SPAN CLASS=command>gets</SPAN></A>, <A HREF=getframe.html><SPAN CLASS=command>getframes</SPAN></A>, <A HREF=do.html><SPAN CLASS=command>dos</SPAN></A>, and <SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN>
 COLLECTs. The default directory (see <SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN> DEFAULT) will be used for
 commands that read or write files. If the file cannot be found in
 the default direcotry, the library directory will be searched.
<P>
 Under UNIX, if the directory name
 begins with a dollar sign ($), it is interpreted as an
 environment variable, set by the user before starting GRAMPS.
<H4>Lowercase</H4>
<P CLASS=indent><SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN> LOWERCASE
<BR 3>
<SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN> NOLOWERCASE
<BR 3>
<BR 1>
</P CLASS=indent> Normally, GRAMPS will translate lower case letters to upper case. If
 you do not want this translation to occur, use the command <SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN>
 NOLOWERCASE. To restore GRAMPS to normal, use the command <SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN>
 LOWERCASE. In either mode of operation, no translation from lower
 case to upper case will take place for strings enclose in quotation
 marks. This is most useful with the <A HREF=text.html><SPAN CLASS=command>text</SPAN></A> command in order to draw
 text using both upper and lower case letters.
<H4>Maxdepth ** esoteric **</H4>
 GRAMPS uses a matrix stack for pushing and popping transformation
 matrices. The software and or hardware may be limited in the size, or
 depth of this stack. The <SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN> MAXDEPTH command allows the user to
 change the maximum depth to which <A HREF=group.html><SPAN CLASS=command>grouping</SPAN></A> can be used (the maximum
 amount of the stack that will be utilized.) The syntax of the command
 is:
<P>
<P CLASS=indent><SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN> MAXDEPTH NUMBER
<BR 3>
<BR 1>
</P CLASS=indent> where NUMBER is any number greater than 0. If the number you give is
 greater than the hardware stack limit minus 1, then the display
 may freak out and give you odd transformations; GRAMPS may even crash.
 The MAXDEPTH is set at the correct maximum value in GRAMPS and there is
 no reason to alter its value, except for play.
<H4>Nooutput</H4>
 The <SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN> NOOUTPUT command stops any graphics output from coming to
 your terminal or to an output file. See the <SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN> OUTPUT command.
<H4>Output</H4>
 The <SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN> OUTPUT command is used to direct the display output of
 GRAMPS somewhere, since it has no preordained place to go.
 Display output may go to a file in .pix or .qix format, or to
 your display screen.
<P>
 If you type <SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN> OUTPUT filename, then output will go to a .pix file
 with the name 'filename'. You can also type <SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN> OUTPUT filename.qix
 to create an output file in .qix format.
<P>
 If you <SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN> OUTPUT WINDOW, output will go to a window on your
 display. You will have to open a window according to the
 method normally used by your window manager for opening new
 windows with the mouse.  If you do not want to use the mouse,
 you may specify the window size and location of the upper left
 as in the following example:
<P>
<P CLASS=indent><SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN> OUTPUT WINDOW 1024x1024+500+100
<BR 3>
<BR 1>
</P CLASS=indent> will make a window 1024 by 1024 pixels, with the origin
 at 500 right and 100 (up or down).
<P>
 The <A HREF=advance.html><SPAN CLASS=command>advance</SPAN></A> command is necessary to initiate any and all displays
 into a file. The <SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN> NOOUTPUT command causes further display
 output to stop, until you use <SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN> OUTPUT again.
<H4>Report</H4>
<P CLASS=indent><SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN> REPORT
<BR 3>
<SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN> NOREPORT
<BR 3>
<BR 1>
</P CLASS=indent> When GRAMPS encounters an error it cannot handle, that error is
 normally reported to the user. The use of the <SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN> NOREPORT command
 causes GRAMPS to neglect reporting of error messages. <SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN> REPORT
 restores the normal error reporting operation.
<H4>Sensitivity</H4>
<P CLASS=indent><SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN> SENSITIVITY number
<BR 3>
<BR 1>
</P CLASS=indent> The effect of the command is to multiply all subsequent dial values by
 the NUMBER given. A large NUMBER decreases the sensitivity with which
 the dials may be used. The default value for the sensitivity is 1.0.
 Real numbers may be used. If the NUMBER given is less than 1.0, then
 the sensitivity will be increased.
<P>
 This command has no effect on the mouse since it is treated in GRAMPS
 as absolute rather than relative devices.
<H4>Smoothline</H4>
 
<p>On a raster system, lines can appear jagged, especially those lines which are 
  nearly but not exactly horizontal or vertical. This is an effect of using discreet 
  pixels on a video screen. Using a method sometimes call anti-aliasing, this 
  effect can be lessened. Use the command <SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN> SMOOTHLINE 
  to enable anti-aliasing of lines. Use the command <SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN> 
  NOSMOOTHLINE to disable anti-aliasing. *** BUT BEWARE **** Because of the way 
  SMOOTHLINE is implemented, fewer colors are available when SMOOTHLINE is set 
  on. Depth-cueing is also affected; there are fewer levels of intensity depth-cueing 
  when <SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN> SMOOTHLINE is used. These effects are due 
  to the color map modifications which are made to make smooth lines. Because 
  the color map is modified, there are differences in the shades of colors corresponding 
  to color values when SMOOTHLINE mode is set. FINALLY, <A HREF=text.html><SPAN CLASS=command>text</SPAN></A> 
  AND POLYGONS ARE NOT DRAWN CORRECTLY WHEN SMOOTHLINE IS <SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN>. 
</p>
<h4>Sphere</h4>
<p>The sphere primitive is rendered as a set of shaded triangles. The set sphere 
  command allows you to specify how high a resolution should be used. The set 
  sphere command takes two arguments, each composed of two integers separated 
  by a dot. For example, set sphere 2.2, 5.2. The first number (2.2 in the example) 
  represents how the sphere should be rendered while the scene is being manipulated 
  using the mouse (or dials) and the second represents how the spheres should 
  be rendered when the scene is still (usually a higher resolution). For each 
  value, the first integer to the left of the dot represents how many triangles 
  (actually how many subdivisions of an icosohedron) should be used and the second 
  number to the right of the dot represents the style (point, line, shaded triangle). 
  So, a value of 1.1 would represent a sphere as an icosohedron using lines and 
  5.2 would represent a sphere as a highly-subdivided icosohedron using shaded 
  triangles. The default values are 2.2 and 5.2.</p>
<H4>Stereo **** use the stereo macro-command ****</H4>
<P CLASS=indent><SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN> STEREO
<BR 3>
<SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN> NOSTEREO
<BR 3>
<BR 1>
</P CLASS=indent> The <SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN> STEREO command causes two drawings of every object to appear
 on the screen. The effect is to create a cross-eyed stereo picture.
 The <SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN> NOSTEREO command returns the display to the normal mode of
 operation. The <SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN> STEREO command also accepts an optional <A HREF=function.html><i>value</i></A>
 which specifies the amount of X translation (stereo separation) to be
 used. The general syntax of the command is:
<P>
<P CLASS=indent><SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN> STEREO <A HREF=function.html><i>value</i></A>
<BR 3>
<BR 1>
</P CLASS=indent> where <A HREF=function.html><i>value</i></A> is any number in the range -1 to +1 (default is
 0.2.) For a lesser stereo effect, use a <A HREF=function.html><i>value</i></A> less than 0.2. For a
 heightened stereo effect use a <A HREF=function.html><i>value</i></A> greater than 0.2. To cause the
 <SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN> STEREO command to create a non-cross-eyed (wall-eyed?) stereo
 view, use a negative <A HREF=function.html><i>value</i></A>.
<P>
 Any transformations applying to LWorld at the time <SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN> STEREO is put
 into effect are copied to RWorld before the <A HREF=perspective.html><SPAN CLASS=command>perspective</SPAN></A>, <A HREF=translate.html><SPAN CLASS=command>translate</SPAN></A>,
 and <A HREF=move.html><SPAN CLASS=command>move</SPAN></A> commands are executed.
<H4>Textsize </H4>
<P CLASS=indent><SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN> TEXTSIZE value
<BR 3>
<BR 1>
</P CLASS=indent> The <SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN> TEXTSIZE command requires a <A HREF=function.html><i>value</i></A> argument in the range 1 to
 100. All subsequent <A HREF=text.html><SPAN CLASS=command>text</SPAN></A> commands will output characters to the screen
 using the text size specified here. 1 is small and 10 is large. The
 default value used by GRAMPS is 7.
<H4>Verify</H4>
<P CLASS=indent><SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN> VERIFY
<BR 3>
<SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN> NOVERIFY
<BR 3>
<BR 1>
</P CLASS=indent> The <SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN> VERIFY command will cause each line of a gin file which is
 being <A HREF=do.html><SPAN CLASS=command>done</SPAN></A> to be printed at the terminal as it is being interpreted.
 The <SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN> NOVERIFY command stops this mode of operation. Commands which
 are typed in at the terminal are not printed since they will already
 appear on the terminal. See also the <SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN> ECHO command.
<H4>Watch</H4>
<P CLASS=indent><SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN> WATCH
<BR 3>
<SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN> NOWATCH
<BR 3>
<BR 1>
</P CLASS=indent> The effect of <SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN> WATCH is to have the display reflect the changes
 made by a gin file as each line is interpreted. Normally, the total
 effect is seen only after the entire file has finished being
 interpreted. The <SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN> WATCH option increases the time for
 interpretation of the gin file slightly, but it is quite entertaining
 and useful for debugging, too. <SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN> NOWATCH cancels this mode of
 operation of GRAMPS.
