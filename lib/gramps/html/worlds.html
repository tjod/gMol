 There are two objects known to GRAMPS that have the names LWorld and
 RWorld. These worlds contain all other objects being displayed.
 Transformations applying to LWorld or RWorld indirectly affect all
 objects on display. For example, any object that is displayed may be
 rotated "with the <A HREF=worlds.html><i>World</i></A>" by rotating LWorld. Of course, any objects
 may be further rotated on its own. <A HREF=perspective.html><SPAN CLASS=command>perspective</SPAN></A> (along with <A HREF=move.html><SPAN CLASS=command>move</SPAN></A>) is a
 unique type of transformation in GRAMPS since it may affect only the
 objects LWorld and RWorld directly. Since LWorld and RWorld contain
 all other objects, <A HREF=perspective.html><SPAN CLASS=command>perspective</SPAN></A> and <A HREF=move.html><SPAN CLASS=command>move</SPAN></A> affect these objects
 indirectly. When GRAMPS is initialized, RWorld is inactive and
 remains inactive until the <A HREF=set.html><SPAN CLASS=command>set</SPAN></A> STEREO command is used.
