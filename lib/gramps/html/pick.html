<HEAD><LINK REL=STYLESHEET TYPE="text/css" HREF="styles.css"></HEAD><H2>PICK</H2>
 The <SPAN CLASS=command>pick</SPAN> command assigns to VARIABLE the name of an object or a
 coordinate point of an object. The syntax of the command is:
<P>
<P CLASS=indent><SPAN CLASS=command>pick/switch</SPAN> VARIABLE [<A HREF=function.html><i>value</i></A>]
<BR 3>
<BR 1>
</P CLASS=indent> where <i>switch</i> is <i>symbol</i>, <i>parameter</i>, or <i>point</i>. VARIABLE is either a #N
 (a point variable), a $<i>symbol</i>, or a $PARAMTER. <A HREF=function.html><i>value</i></A> is optional. If
 <A HREF=function.html><i>value</i></A> is missing, then the VARIABLE is assigned a <A HREF=function.html><i>value</i></A> by using the
 mouse to pick the $<i>symbol</i>, $<i>parameter</i>, or #N point. If the <A HREF=function.html><i>value</i></A> is
 given, then the VARIABLE is assigned that <A HREF=function.html><i>value</i></A>, and the mouse is not
 used. The <SPAN CLASS=switch>/wait</SPAN> switch is used in combination with the switches in
 gin files. See also <A HREF=use.html><SPAN CLASS=command>use/axis</SPAN></A>. 
<H4>/parameter</H4>
 <SPAN CLASS=switch>/parameter</SPAN> - The value of a $<i>parameter</i> may be changed by using the
 <SPAN CLASS=command>pick/parameter</SPAN> command. The syntax of this command is:
<P>
<P CLASS=indent><SPAN CLASS=command>pick/parameter</SPAN> $<i>parameter</i> "string"
<BR 3>
<BR 1>
</P CLASS=indent> where $<i>parameter</i> is a $<i>parameter</i> ($1 through $10) and
 "string" is any character string up to 40 characters.
 The double quotation marks are not necessary unless the
 string contains DELIMITERs or a string which could be
 interpreted as a $<i>parameter</i>. This latter restriction is
 necessary since a $<i>parameter</i> may be assigned the value of
 another $<i>parameter</i>.
<P>
 The <SPAN CLASS=command>pick/parameter</SPAN> command is only valid in .gin command
 files. Usually, the <SPAN CLASS=switch>/wait</SPAN> switch is used with <SPAN CLASS=switch>/parameter</SPAN>
 in .gin files.
<P>
 If the "string" is not given in the command, then GRAMPS
 will assign the $<i>parameter</i> the <i>name</i> of the next object
 picked using the mouse.
<H4>/point</H4>
 <SPAN CLASS=switch>/point</SPAN> - The <SPAN CLASS=command>pick/point</SPAN> command has the following syntax:
<P>
<P CLASS=indent><SPAN CLASS=command>pick/point</SPAN> #NUMBER [X,Y,Z,W]
<BR 3>
<BR 1>
</P CLASS=indent> where NUMBER is any value from 1 through 10. The other
 arguments are <A HREF=function.html><i>values</i></A> specifying the coordinates of a point.
 The symbol # is a required part of the syntax of this
 command. The effect of the <SPAN CLASS=command>pick/point</SPAN> command is to store
 the coordinates of a point in a variable named by #1 through
 #10. The current limit on the number of axes that may be
 picked and remembered is 10 (1 through 10.) Once two points
 are picked, they may be used in the <A HREF=use.html><SPAN CLASS=command>use/axis</SPAN></A> command.
<P>
 If no <A HREF=function.html><i>value</i></A> is specified, then the mouse is used by GRAMPS to
 fill in the <A HREF=function.html><i>value</i></A>.
<H4>/symbol</H4>
 <SPAN CLASS=switch>/symbol</SPAN> - The value of a $<i>symbol</i> may be changed by using the
 <SPAN CLASS=command>pick/symbol</SPAN> command. The syntax of this command is:
<P>
<P CLASS=indent><SPAN CLASS=command>pick/symbol</SPAN> $<i>symbol</i> "string"
<BR 3>
<BR 1>
</P CLASS=indent> where $<i>symbol</i> is a $<i>symbol</i> ($1 through $10) and "string" is
 any character string up to 12 characters. The double
 quotation marks are not necessary, unless the string
 contains DELIMITERs or a string which could be interpreted
 as a $<i>symbol</i>. This latter restriction is necessary since a
 $<i>symbol</i> may be assigned the value of another $<i>symbol</i>.
<P>
 The <SPAN CLASS=command>pick/symbol</SPAN> command is only valid at GRAMPS terminal
 command level.
<P>
 If the "string" is not given in the command, then GRAMPS
 will assign the $<i>symbol</i> the <i>name</i> of the next object picked
 using the mouse.
<H4>/wait</H4>
 If a <SPAN CLASS=command>pick</SPAN> command is used within a gin file, you will probably
 want to wait until the user <SPAN CLASS=command>picks</SPAN> the object before
 continuing.  The <SPAN CLASS=switch>/wait</SPAN> switch will ensure that GRAMPS waits
 until a hit does occur.  If you do not use the <SPAN CLASS=switch>/wait</SPAN> switch,
 the results of the <SPAN CLASS=command>pick</SPAN> may be incorrect.  If you want to pick
 both a <i>parameter</i> and a <i>point</i>, give the <SPAN CLASS=switch>/wait</SPAN> <i>switch</i> only on the
 latter of the two commands. For example, <i>pick/parameter/wait</i> $1
 followed by <i>pick/point/wait</i> #3 will require two pen picks;
 <SPAN CLASS=command>pick/parameter</SPAN> $2 followed by <i>pick/point/wait</i> #5 will require
 only one pick, but will return $2 and #5.
