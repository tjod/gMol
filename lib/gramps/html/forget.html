 The <SPAN CLASS=command>forget</SPAN> command is used to cause objects to be forgotten by GRAMPS.
 The name of the object and all information about the object as well as
 the display of the object are forgotten. The memory previously used
 by the object is reclaimed. The syntax of the command is:
<P>
<P CLASS=indent><SPAN CLASS=command>forget</SPAN> <i>name</i>
<BR 3>
<BR 1>
</P CLASS=indent> where <i>name</i> is any object name known to GRAMPS. No disk files are ever
 affected by this command.
<P>
 If <i>name</i> is a <A HREF=synonym.html><SPAN CLASS=command>synonym</SPAN></A> and it is the original (master) synonym, then all
 synonyms referring to <i>name</i> are also forgotten. If <i>name</i> is not the
 master synonym, only that reference is forgotten. If <i>name</i> is a group,
 all members of the group are forgotten, except those members that are
 master synonyms. Members of a group that are synonyms, but not master
 synonyms, will be forgotten. If <i>name</i> is a group and also a master
 synonym, then all synonym groups referring to the <i>named</i> group are also
 forgotten, except those members of the <i>named</i> group or group referring
 to <i>name</i> which are master synonyms. In general, master synonyms are
 never forgotten, be they groups or not, unless they are specifically
 <i>named</i> in the <SPAN CLASS=command>forget</SPAN> command. Master synonyms are never implicitly
 forgotten because they belong to a group being forgotten. All other
 objects (even non-master synonyms) may be implicitly forgotten because
 they belong to the <i>named</i> group to be forgotten, or because they refer
 to the <i>named</i> master synonym being forgotten.
