<H2>Water potential energy surface</H2>
This is a representation of the potential energy surface of H + H + O.
That is a 4-dimensional surface: the potential energy and the
three (3n-6) internal degrees of freedom of the three atom system.
<p>
Here, we see only a 3-dimensional surface at any one time.
The axis labelled V is the potential energy.
The axis labelled H-H is the (symmetric) distance of H from the H-H center.
The axis labelled O is the distance of O from the H-H center.
This leaves one degree of freedom that can be expressed as the rotation
of H-H around its center.
Initially, the 3-D surface is shown with the rotation angle set at 90 degrees -
the surface on which the global minimum for water is located.
<p>
To better see the surface, you may rotate the view by moving the mouse using the
left mouse button.
<p>
You may move the yellow stick around on the surface using
the right mouse button.  The red O and 2 white H atoms
correspond to the location of the stick on the surface.
The guidelines help you to see the location along the
H-H and O axes.
<p>
<FORM NAME=buttons>
The remaining degree of freedom is a parameter in this animation.
It correpsonds the rotation of H-H around the H-H center.
When this parameter is changed, the surface "warps"
to reflect the correct shape for this rotation angle.
Use the mouse scroll wheel to control:

You can select a few interesing points on the surface.
