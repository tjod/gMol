The directories here contain gramps demonstration files.
To run them, cd to the chosen directory, and run gramps.
Type the command 'demo' to gramps.  You will see a brief
description of what the demo is about and how to interact
with it.  To exit the demo, type 'quit'.  Remember you must
have the gramps_lib environment variable set correctly.

WARNING: The files here were created using the OLDUNITS
units in gramps, in which 32767=180degrees of rotation,
1.0 units of translation, etc.  This is all taken care
of easily with the 'set oldunits' command at the top
of demo.gin in each of the sub-directories here.
The .gin files called by demo all inherit the oldunits
and work properly.  The warning is, if you wish to use
certain .gin files in these directories WITHOUT being called
by demo, you may have to add 'set oldunits' to the top of
them for them to work properly.
