<H2>Glyphosate-water interaction surfaces</H2>
This is a representation of the interaction of
 water with glyphosate, also known as Roundup<sup>&reg;</sup>.
<p>
The surfaces were generated using the gramps utility
 program isosurf which produces 3-D contours from a 3-D
 grid of data (a scalar field).
 The data were generated using the Grin/grid programs.
 The data are potential
 energies of interaction of a water probe with the
 glyphosate molecule.
<p>
The light blue surface is a contour at 0.01 kcal, just
 where the potential is becoming repulsive (positive).
 This represents a "water-accessible" surface.  This
 surface may be made transparent using the mouse wheel.
<p>
The gold surface is a contour at -9 kcal, near the minimum
 at -9.5kcal.  This locates where a water molecule  most
 favorably interacts with glyphosate.  Other contours,
 at -7, -5 and -3 kcal may be displayed by moving the mouse
using the right
 mouse button.
<p>
Summary of mouse useage:
<blockquote>
         left button:     rotate the whole scene
<br>
         wheel:    transparency of blue surface
<br>
         right button:    change contour level of gold surface
